##Scope

Where to look for things

Compiled vs interpretered languages:

- Interpreted languages: goes from top to bottom, only knows about current line, doesn't look ahead.
- Compiled languages: possibly does a look over once, then does a second pass through to execute code.

JavaScript is a compiled language - compiler looks over the code once, then comes back and processes.
JavaScript has function scope only*

```js
var foo = "bar"; // global scope

function bar() {
  var foo = "baz"; // bar function scope
}

function baz(foo) {
  foo = "bam"; // baz function scope
  bam = "yay"; // baz function scope
}
```

###LHS/RHS (of assignment)

LHS - left-hand side
RHS - right-hand side

`var foo = "bar";`
Compiler: I have a LHS reference for a variable called `foo`; ever heard of him?
Scope Manager: Yes, you declared him several microseconds ago. Here he is.

`function bar() { var foo = "baz"; }`
Compiler: Hey, scope of `bar`, I have a LHS reference for a variable named `foo`. Ever heard of him?
Scope Manager: ...

Compiler asks local scope first.

`function baz(foo) { foo = "bam";`
Compiler: Hey, scope of `baz`, I have a LHS reference for a variable named `foo`. Ever heard of him?
Scope Manager: ...

`bam = "yay"; }`
Compiler: Hey, scope of `baz`, I have a LHS reference for a variable named `bam`. Ever heard of him?
Scope Manager: Nope, "go fish"

Compiler now has to go up one level of scope; out of local scope, working towards global scope.
Compiler: Hey, global scope, I have a LHS reference for a variable named `bam`. Ever heard of him?
Scope Manager: Yes, I just created him for you.

Due to being in non-strict mode, and it being a LHS reference, global scope will create it when asked about the reference. If we were in strict mode, the answer would be "Nope, never heard of him" from Scope Manager.

###Undeclared !== undefined
An undeclared variable: unable to find a proper LHS reference in any scopes.
An undefined variable: was declared, but is uninitialized, doesn't currently have a value. Undefined is a value, called undefined.

###Scope Execution

```js
var foo = "bar"; // global scope

function bar() { // entering bar scope
  var foo = "baz";

  function baz(foo) { // entering baz scope
    foo = "bam";
    bam = "yay";
  }
  baz();
}

bar();
foo; //"bar"
bam; //"yay"
baz();
```

Code before execution:

Compiler: Global scope, I have a RHS reference for variable called bar.
Scope Manager: Here ya go!

Now execution jumps in `bar` function.

`var foo = "baz";` is considered shadowing due to local scope being interpreted first.

`baz()`; is executed

At `bam` within `baz` function, we will get a "Go fish" from local scope. Lookup carries on to `bar` scope, which will be "Go fish". After that lookup carries on to global scope, which will be "I just made him for you! Here ya go."

Because of this execution order `bam` will execute to "yay" due to it being defined in global scope (if not in strict mode).

When asking for RHS reference of `baz()` in non-strict, `baz()` is not created automatically, and will result in a `ReferenceError`.

###Function Declarations, Function Expression (Named and Anonymous)

```js
var foo = function bar() {
  var foo = "baz";

  function baz(foo) {
    foo = bar;
    foo; // function...
  }
  baz();
};

foo();
bar(); // Error!
```

`var foo = function bar() {}` is a named function expression. And `bar` is not defined in the outer scope, but is accessible inside the function.

Function declaration is `function foo() {}`.
Named Function expression is `var foo = function bar() {}`.
Anonymous function expression is `var foo = function () {}`.

**Always use named function expression to help debugging in stack traces, and for documentation.**

Typically a named function expression is prefered over an anonymous function expression.

###Block Scope

```js
var foo;

try {
  foo.length;
}
catch (err) {
  console.log(err); // TypeError
}

console.log(err); // ReferenceError
```

In a try/catch, the catch clause has block scope. Therefore all scope within the catch clause isn't accessible outside of the catch clause.

###Lexical Scope

Two types of scope: lexical and dynamic. Very few languages use dynamic scope.

Lexical scope gets it's name from the lex(ing), the parsing stage of the compiler.

Lexical scope means compile time scope. Decisions about scope are made in the lexing phase of compiling.

Lexical scope can be thought of as a building. You look for something in the first floor of the building. If you don't find it there, you go up a floor and look there. On and on till you get to the top floor, which is the global scope.

```js
function foo() {
  var bar = "bar";

  function baz() {
    console.log(bar); // lexical!
  }
  baz();
}
foo();
```

Scope can be thought of bubbles: a baz bubble scope, a foo bubble scope, and global scope.

###Cheating Lexical Scope with `eval` (evil)

`eval` takes a string and treats it as code that existed at compile time.

```js
var bar = "bar";

function foo(str) {
  eval(str); // cheating!
  console.log(bar); // 42
}

foo("var bar = 42;");
```

`eval` cheats by modifying a write-time lexical decision and makes it a run-time lexical decision.

JS can't optimize lookups if it encounters an `eval`. JavaScript runs slower if `eval` is used.
While in strict mode, code is more optimizable.

`eval` shouldn't be used, unless absolutely necessary. An example of a necessary time to use `eval` might be in a templating engine.

`setTimeout('code goes here')` is using `eval`. Use the function-based `setTimeout`.

###Cheating Lexical Scope with `with`

```js
var obj = {
  a: 2,
  b: 3,
  c: 4
};

obj.a = obj.b + obj.c;
obj.c = obj.b - obj.a;

with (obj) {
  a = b + c;
  c = b - a;
  d = 3;
}

obj.d; // undefined
d; // 3 --oops!
```

When asking for LHS reference, lexical lookup wouldn't find `d`, but asking global scope would then create `d`.

`with` is even more evil than `eval`. `with` creates a new lexical scope at run-time.
In strict-mode `with` is not allowed at all.

##IIFE

Immediately-invoked function expression, or IIFE (iffy). Function expression (named or anonymouse) that immediately invokes itself.

```js
var foo = "foo";

(function() {
  var foo = "foo2";
  console.log(foo); // "foo2"
})(); // "donkey balls"

console.log(foo); // "foo"
```

One way to make function declaration an expression is simply by not making `function` the first keyword.

```js
var foo = "foo";

(function(bar){
  var foo = bar;
  console.log(foo); // "foo"
})(foo);

console.log(foo); // "foo"
```

Optional syntax:

```js
(function() {
  
}()) // non-"donkey balls"
```

###`let` and Block Scope

`let` will be attached to the block it appears in.

```js
function foo() {
  var bar = "bar";
  for (let i = 0; i < bar.length; i++) {
    console.log(bar.charAt(i));
  }
  console.log(i); // ReferenceError
}
foo();
```

```js
function foo(bar) {
  if (bar) {
    let baz = bar;
    if (baz) {
      let bam = baz;
    }
    console.log(bam); // Error
  }
  console.log(baz); // Error
}

foo("bar");
```

Using `let` allow garbage collection to be done earlier, because scoping is on the block, not the function.

`let` does not hoist.

###Dynamic Scope

```js
// theoretical dynamic scoping
function foo() {
  console.log(bar); // dynamic!
}

function baz() {
  var bar = "bar";
  foo();
}

baz();
```

**Decision for how scoping works in dynamic scoping is a run-time decision. Lexical scoping it write-time decision**

###Hoisting

_Hoisting isn't an actual thing._ It's a mental construct we invented to explain the behaviors of JavaScript.

```js
a;
b;
var a = b;
var b = 2;
b;
a;
```

In actuality:

```js
var a;
var b;
a;
b;
a = b;
b = 2;
b;
a;
```

---

```js
var a = b();
var c = d();
a;
c;

function b() {
  return c;
}

var d = function() {
  return b();
};
```

In actuality:

```js
function b() {
  return c;
}
var a;
var c;
var d;
a = b();
c = d();
a;
c;
d = function () {
  return b();
};
```

Hoisting - functions first:

```js
foo(); // "foo"
var foo = 2;

function foo() {
  console.log("bar");
}

function foo() {
  console.log("foo");
}
```

Mutual recursion: two functions call each other

```js
a(1);

function a(foo) {
  if (foo > 20) return foo;
  return b(foo+2);
}
function b(foo) {
  return c(foo) + 1;
}
function c(foo) {
  return a(foo*2);
}

//answer is 39
```

Header files in various languages are necessary because that language doesn't do automatic hoisting.

Referencing in the temporal dead zone is referencing a `let` before it is "hoisted".

###`this` keyword, implicit and default binding

Every function, **while executing**, has a refrence to its current execution content called _this_.

Call site determines binding of `this`.

4 rules for `this` keyword being bound (in order of precidence):

1. `this` bound to brand new object due to constructor call hijack.
2. Explicit binding rule - Example usage `.call` or `.apply`, and declaring `this`, then `this` is `this` that is passed in.
3. Implicit binding rule - that object at call site (base object, context object) becomes `this`.
4. Default binding rule - determined by strict mode:
  a. strict mode - default `this` to undefined value
  b. non strict mode - default `this` to global object

4 questions to ask about `this` binding:

1. Was the function called with the `new` keyword? If so, use that object.
2. Was the function called with `call` or `apply` specifying an explicit this?
3. Was the function called via a containing/owning object (context)?
4. DEFAULT: global object (except strict mode).

```js
function foo() {
  console.log(this.bar);
}

var bar = "bar1":
var o2 = { bar: "bar2", foo: foo };
var o3 = { bar: "bar3", foo: foo };

foo(); // "bar1"
o2.foo(); // "bar2"
o3.foo(); // "bar3"
```

```js
var o1 = {
  bar: "bar1",
  foo: function() {
    console.log(this.bar);
  }
};
var o2 = { bar: "bar2", foo: o1.foo };

var bar = "bar3"
var foo = o1.foo;

o1.foo(); // "bar1"
o2.foo(); // "bar2"
foo(); // "bar3"
```

You **cannot** mix lexical scope and this binding.

####Hard binding

Make `this` a predictable reference.

```js
function foo() {
  console.log(this.bar);
}

var obj = { bar: "bar" };
var obj2 = { bar: "bar2" };

var orig = foo;
foo = function() { orig.call(obj); };

foo(); // "bar"
foo.call(obj2); // "bar"
```

```js
function bind(fn, o) {
  return function() {
    fn.call(o);
  };
}

function foo() {
  console.log(this.bar);
}

var obj = { bar: "bar" };
var obj2 = { bar: "bar2" };

foo = bind(foo, obj);

foo(); // "bar"
foo.call(obj2); // "bar"
```

```js
if (!Function.prototype.bind2) {
  Function.prototype.bind2 = 
    function(o) {
      var fn = this; // the function!
      return function() {
        return fn.apply(o, arguments);
      };
    };
}

function foo(baz) {
  console.log(this.bar + " " + baz);
}

var obj = { bar: "bar" };
foo = foo.bind2(obj);

foo("baz"); // "bar baz"
```
There is already a Function.prototype.bind

### `new` keyword
`new` has nothing to do with Objects in JavaScript.

`new` turns that function call into a "constructor" call.

4 things happens when using `new`:

1. Brand new object is created out of thin air.
2. Object gets linked to a different object.
3. Object gets bound as `this` for function call.
4. If function doesn't return anything, then implicitly insert `return this;`.

```js
function foo() {
  this.baz = "baz";
  console.log(this.bar + " " + baz);
}

var bar = "bar";
var baz = new foo(); // undefined undefined
console.log(baz.baz); // "baz"
```
