# 3. Object-Oriented

- prototype
- "Inheritance" vs. "Behavior Delegation"

C++ and Java are not object-oriented, but rather "class" oriented. Only two languages, Lua and JavaScript, that deserve the moniker "object" oriented. These two are the only ones you can create an objects without a class.

There are no "classes" in JavaScript. JavaScript is not a "class-based" language, but rather an "object-based" language.

## prototype

Every single "object" is built by a constructor function.

Each time a constructor is called, a new object is created.

A constructor makes an object ~~"based on"~~ linked to its own prototype.

Based on implies a copy stamped out. Linked to is different.

```js
function Foo(who) {
  this.me = who;
}

Foo.prototype.identify = function() {
  return "I am" + this.me;
};

var a1 = new Foo("a1");
var a2 = new Foo("a2");

a2.speak = function() {
  alert("Hello, " + this.identify() + ".");
};

a1.constructor === Foo;
a1.constructor === a2.constructor;
a1.__proto__ === Foo.prototype;
a1.__proto__ === a2.__proto__;
```

The Object function is linked to an object via Object.prototype. Various methods on that object is `toString()`, `valueOf()`, etc.

Line 1 creates a Foo function linked to an object via `.prototype`. That object is also linked to the Foo function via `.constructor`. 

**`.constructor` is not resemblent of what created that object.**

Line 4 adds an `identify` property directly on the Foo object.

Line 8 creates a new Foo object, which does the following:

1. Creates a new Foo object
2. Link the new Foo object the Foo function's prototype object
3. `this` points at that new Foo object
4. Returns `this` which gets assigned to `a1`

There is no classes, inheritance, or instantiation in JavaScript.

Line 9 does the same 4 things as Line 8, but with a new Foo object

Line 11 adds a `speak` property to the `a2` object. `a1.speak` would not work, because `speak` is only on `a2` right now.

There is no `constructor` property on `a1` on line 15. Because it doesn't exist on `a1`, it goes up the prototype chain via prototype linkages called `[[Prototype]]` to look for `constructor`. Because Foo's object has a `constructor` property pointing back to the `Foo` function, it is returned.

Line 15 and 16 return true.

There is no `__proto__` (dunder proto) on `a1`, nor on Foo's prototype. There is `__proto__` on Object's prototype though, which is linked to Foo's prototype via `[[Prototype]]`.

`__proto__` is a getter function that returns the prototype linkage to the `this` binding.

Line 17 returns `a1`'s `__proto__` (Foo's prototype) which a public property that exposes an internal characteristic. Line 17 evaluates to true;

Line 18 evaluates to true because `a1.__proto__` is `Foo.prototype` and `a2.__proto__` is `Foo.prototype`.

Because `__proto__` wasn't valid until ES6, ES5 added `Object.getPrototypeOf()`.

`a1.__proto__ === Object.getPrototypeOf(a1);` evalutes to true because `getPrototypeOf()` returns that object's linkage.

`a2.__proto__ == a2.constructor.prototype;` evalutes to true. `constructor` and `prototype` are writable properties and can be changes to point anywhere.

### Prototype Linkages

`a1` doesn't have an `identify` property however when called, it will traverse the prototype chain and run `a1.__proto__.identify`.

The `this` binding when calling `a1.identify` evaluates to the `a1` object (rule 3 - implicit site binding).

```js
function Foo(who) {
  this.me = who;
}

Foo.prototype.identify = function() {
  return "I am" + this.me;
};

var a1 = new Foo("a1");
a1.identify(); // "I am a1"

a1.identify = function() { // <-- Shadowing!!
  alert("Hello, " + Foo.prototype.identify.call(this) + ".");
};

a1.identify(); // alerts: "Hello, I am a1."
```

Line 11 adds an `identify` property to the a1 object, which therefore shadows on the prototype chain. When calling `a1.identify`, the `identify` property on `a1` will always be returned, not `a1.__proto__.identify`.

Line 13 is necessary to call `identify` on `a1`'s prototype, because of shadowing.

```js
function Foo(who) {
  this.me = who;
}

Foo.prototype.identify = function() {
  return "I am" + this.me;
};

Foo.prototype.speak = function() {
  alert("Hello, " + this.identify() + "."); // super unicorn magic
}

var a1 = new Foo("a1");
a1.speak(); // alerts: "Hello, I am a1"
```

### Objects Linked

```js
function Foo(who) {
  this.me = who;
}
Foo.prototype.identify = function() {
  return "I am" + this.me;
};

function Bar(who) {
  Foo.call(this, who);
}
// Bar.prototype = new Foo(); // Or...
Bar.prototype = Object.create(Foo.prototype);
// NOTE: .constructor is borked here, need to fix

Bar.prototype.speak = function() {
  alert("Hello, " + this.identify() + ".");
};

var b1 = new Bar("b1");
var b2 = new Bar("b2");

b1.speak(); // alerts: "Hello, I am b1."
b2.speak(); // alerts: "Hello, I am b2."
```

`Object.create()` does the first 2 of the 4 steps that the `new` keyword does:

1. Creates a new object
2. Links `this` to that object

### Inheritance vs Behavior Delegation

Inheritance: copy down
JavaScript: delegation up

These two are not equal. Therefore, fundamentally, JavaScript doesn't have inheritance, but does have Behavior Delegation.

### OLOO

OLOO: Objects Linked to Other Objects

`new Whatever` is class based, not JavaScript-y.

To replace `var b1 = new Bar()`:

```js
var b1 = Object.create(Bar.prototype);
Bar.call(b1, "b1");
```

Polyfill for Object.create
```js
if (!Object.create) {
  Object.create = function (o) {
    function F() {}
    F.prototype = o;
    return new F();
  };
}
```

How is JS's `[[Prototype]]` chain not like traitional/classical inheritance? It doesn't copy, it links.

Behavior delegation is better than classical inheritance because the linking allows dynamic function changes. In classical inheritance there is a "snapshot" of the class that creates the object, so adding methods to objects afterwards is necessary.
